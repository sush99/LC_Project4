                    <h2>Sceptile</h2>
                    <p>Sceptile is my #1 favorite pokemon, and one of the first pokemon that i've 
                        ever had. He the Grass type starter from the Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald games and 
                        what caused me to love grass type pokemon from then till now. Whenever he does
                        his "Mega Evolution", he becomes the first Grass/Dragon type Pokemon, and one of 3
                        that have existed till now.

                 <h2>Lucario</h2>
                 <p>Lucario is a Steel/Fighting type pokemon introduced in Diamond/Pearl. I loved his design from when I was a kid and still love it to this day.
                     He has the ability to use special Fighting type moves, which was introduced in that generation of Pokemon 
                     games.  </p>

                 <h2>Torterra</h2>
                 <p>Torterra is the Grass/Ground starter from Diamond/Pearl. He is probably the pokemon that I have used
                     the most in all the years that i've played the series.  His design is pretty interesting; as he evolves
                     he gets more land on his back growing from a small bush to a blooming ecosystem.

                 <h2>Gallade</h2>
                 <p>Gallade is a Psychic/Fighting type introduced in Diamond/Pearl/ I really liked this design as a kid because
                     Gallade has swords for hands and that was the coolest thing to me as a kid. He seemed like a white knight type of
                    character, which reminded me of arthurian legends whenever I first saw him.  </p>

                 <h2>Luxray</h2>
                 <p>Luxray is an Electric type introduced in Diamond/Pearl. His design goes from a lion cub to a proper king of the jungle, and he just 
                     looks really cool to boot.

                 <h2>Staraptor</h2>
                 <p>Staraptor is a Normal/Flying type introduced in Diamond/Pearl. Every generation of pokemon has thier version of a bird that you find early in the game. 
                     Of these, Staraptor is my favorite because it, and Toretrra, were able to stay alive long enough to help me beat the final boss of Pokemon Pearl. His 
                     design being a little "edgier" than most also appealed to 9-year old me as well.
